# deadlock-artifacts

Each time a major new game update comes out, I like to poke around in the various game DLLs to see what's new and what's changed.

These are just little snippets and artifacts that I like having around because it gives me fun console commands to play around with
in custom games with friends, or while hanging out in the lobby.

I'm just putting them here so I have a place to reference them easily, and because there aren't many good resources online about
all of the various commands or items or whatnot available in the game.

(if valve reads this: thank u for the great game :D)
